A DashClock Extension for Live Cricket Scores

*Important:* You need to install [Dashclock Widget]("http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.nurik.roman.dashclock) for this extension to work. Please install and configure DashClock first, before installing this extension.

DashCricket shows live cricket scores right on your lock screen, without having to open any app. You can tap on the score anytime to see the full scorecard. Pick a live score from the settings screen and you are good to go. If you are someone who checks the score multiple times during a match, then this one is for you.
